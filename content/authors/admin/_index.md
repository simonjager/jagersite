I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

Before Joining MIT, I worked at the Institute on Behavior and Inequality (briq) as a postdoctoral researcher. My research focuses on labor, public, and behavioral economics. I combine experimental and quasi-experimental methods with large, administrative datasets to shed light on the functioning of labor markets and the origins and consequences of inequality.

I received my PhD in economics from Harvard University.

Here is my {{< staticref "uploads/resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}full CV{{< /staticref >}}.
